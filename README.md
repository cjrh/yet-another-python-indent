# yet-another-python-indent

> "This can't be that hard, right?"

A custom `indentexpr` function for Python files in Neovim.

## Installation

### Using vim-plug

Add the following line to your `init.vim` or `init.lua`:

```vim
Plug 'cjrh/yet-another-python-indent'
```

Then run `:PlugInstall`.

If you find this sucks just as badly as the others, you can 
delete the `Plug` line above and then remove it with `:PlugClean`.
