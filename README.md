# yet-another-python-indent

> "This can't be that hard, right?"

A custom `indentexpr` function for Python files in Neovim.

## Installation

### Using vim-plug

Add the following line to your `init.vim` or `init.lua`:

```vim
Plug 'cjrh/yet-another-python-indent'
```

Then run `:PlugInstall`.

If you find this sucks just as badly as the others, you can 
delete the `Plug` line above and then remove it with `:PlugClean`.

## Contributing

I am intending and expecting that only I will 
ever use this plugin. As such it will cater to my
preferences. I am open to bugfixes against the intended
behaviour of the current code but I'm unlikely to consider
PRs that expand the scope of the plugin or add many tweaks
and options to change behaviour. Feel free to for the
repo and customize for yourself.
